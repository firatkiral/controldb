// Since we don't pass a name parameter, our database will have 
//   default name of 'controldb'
var db = new controldb();

// controldb is mostly synchronous except for persistence adapters.
// Since we are not auto-loading a persisted database in this
//   example, controldb is entirely synchronous.

// add simple 'users' collection with default options
var users = db.addCollection("users");

// insert some documents
users.insert({name:'odin', age: 50});
users.insert({name:'thor', age: 35});
users.insert({name:'controldb', age: 30});

// run a 'find' query with a 'less-than-or-equal' range operator
//   to grab two of our documents.
var result = users.find({ age : { $lte: 35 } });

// inspect the result with sandbox logger.
// As documents are inserted into our collection they have 
//   $ctrl property added which is a unique id you can pass to 
//   collection.get(). They also have 'meta' property added which 
//   is used internally.
